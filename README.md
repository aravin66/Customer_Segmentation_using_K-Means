## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. Load the dataset using Pandas  
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis using graphs and statistics  
4. Select relevant features (Income & Spending Score)  
5. Apply Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters  
6. Train K-Means model  
7. Plot results and visualize clusters  
8. Interpret segmentation and generate insights
